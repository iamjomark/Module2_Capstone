Monetizing Mobility: Leveraging Strategic Partnerships to Offset Free Fare Costs in Public Transit

This project is part of the Module 2 Capstone, based on the April 2023 TransJakarta sample dataset.

Dataset Description

Transjakarta.csv: Main dataset containing detailed ridership data for April 2023.

Transjakarta.docx: Glossary of variable definitions used in the dataset.

Letak_Geografis_Jabodetabek.csv: Geographic reference file for mapping stops to regions across Jabodetabek.

M2_CS_Jonathan.ipynb: Final Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analyses.

Introduction

TransJakarta is the first and largest Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Southeast Asia, offering fast, affordable, and accessible public transport across Jakarta and the surrounding Jabodetabek area. Since its establishment in 2004, it has expanded to over 13 main corridors and 200+ routes.

Service Types and Fare Overview

Paid Services: BRT, AMARI (night service), Integrasi, TransJabodetabek – Rp3,500

Premium Service: Royal Trans – Rp20,000

Free Services: Mikrotrans, Rusun (public housing), and Tourism routes – Rp0

This Jupyter Notebook explores insights from 2023 ridership data, highlights a key operational issue identified through exploratory analysis, and proposes a targeted solution to help TransJakarta enhance its performance while supporting affordable mobility.

Problem Statement

While free services like Mikrotrans play an essential role in accessibility, they contribute to significant revenue shortfalls. These routes, often located in underserved areas, serve many commuters but do not generate income through fares. To maintain and expand these services, TransJakarta must explore alternative sources of funding.

This analysis highlights the usage trends of free versus paid services and recommends a monetization strategy through strategic partnerships and advertising.

Market Segments (Demographic Insights)

Analyzing rider demographics reveals patterns useful for targeted partnerships:

Female passengers dominate the ridership, especially in the 18–36 age range.

Younger riders (18–36) contribute the highest trip counts and revenue.

Peak Time Slots for Advertising

High-traffic periods offer opportunities for advertising partnerships:

Prime Time: 05.00–10.00 and 16.00–21.00

Golden Hour: 06.00–07.00 and 17.00–18.00 (most exclusive)

Premium plans apply only on weekdays

Advertising Strategies

Livery, Vehicle Wraps, and Onboard Ads

Free services can be monetized through visual advertising strategies:

Branding of tourism buses and Mikrotrans units

3D and full-wrap advertisements

Custom livery for long-term brand exposure

Naming Rights and Permanent Placements

Transit stops and high-traffic corridors offer long-term monetization potential:

Suitable for product placements, campaign messages, and corporate branding

Increases brand recall and commuter engagement

Stops with high passenger volumes command higher pricing

MRT Jakarta reports IDR 3–33 billion annual revenue per stop

Tools and Libraries Used

Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy)

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Folium, GeoPandas
